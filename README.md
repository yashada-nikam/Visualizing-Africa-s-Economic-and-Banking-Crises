# Visualizing-Africa-s-Economic-and-Banking-Crises


This project, "Visualizing Africa's Economic and Banking Crises: Exploratory Data Analysis from 1860
to 2014," looks into the details of Banking, Debt, Financial, Inflation, and Systemic Crises in 13 African
countries. Over more than a century, from 1860 to 2014, the study understands the economy of nations
like Algeria, Angola, Central African Republic, Ivory Coast, Egypt, Kenya, Mauritius, Morocco, Nigeria,
South Africa, Tunisia, Zambia, and Zimbabwe. The project starts by looking at a big dataset with
important info like systemic crises, exchange rates, debt defaults, inflation rates, and more. It gives us
useful insights into their financial stability.

Using data visualization and analysis, we want to study patterns, trends, and connections in the dataset.
By showing these past economic events visually, we want to answer important questions about what
causes economic crises and what they mean. Are there common things in countries that had crises? How
does inflation affect these crises? How has banking stability changed? Using data science tools, this
project helps us understand past economic problems and gives us a base to know more about Africa's
financial history. The things we find and show will help us understand the continent's financial history
better. They could also help with making decisions about policies and strategies for the economy in the
future, aiming for stability and growth.
